**Q&A**

*How do I install the theme*
Download the latest version from the gitHub repository and add a text/css type link in the pages where you want to use the theme. You should set the href to the *absolution.blue.css* file! Do not forget the images folder!  
Example: <link type="text/css" href="absolution.blue.css" rel="stylesheet" />  


*But I want a different color*
No problem, if it is already generated then just replace the name of the file above. Otherwise, you have to change the color values in the .less files and either recompile the file or include the LESS javascript in the page where you're using the theme.

*Why did you remove the option to include separate widgets*
Sometimes I like to push new technologies. The usage of LESS was a huge improvement for the readability of the code and the ability to change it fast. This came however at the cost of compiling which I do in a minimized single file to make the file smaller. There is however the option to include the necessary LESS files in your page along with the LESS javascript which will process those files.

*Where can I find LESS*
You are a no brainer aren't you? http://LMGTFY.com/?q=less

*The theme previews are slow*
That's because they are brand new and instantly loaded from the gitHub repository which results in a small delay. This will be different when you use it on your server.
